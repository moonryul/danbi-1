    //OnValidate is called by Unity on Components whenever a serialized property of
    //that component is changed. That includes "sub-properties" in custom classes.
    //    Unity doesn't serialize custom classes on their own. 
    //    They are simply treated like "structs". 
    //    So all properties of a custom class simply become properties of the MonoBehaviour
    //    class that exposes your custom class.

    //    So when you change a variable in the inspector,
    //    no matter if it's an actual field of the MonoBehaviour or 
    //    if it's nested in a custom class,
    //    Unity will call the OnValidate method of the MonoBehaviour.
    //    If you want to apply special handling in the custom class itself, 
    //    you can simply add your own OnValidate method and 
    //    call it from the MonoBehaviour that contains that class:

    private void OnValidate()
    {
        //// This function is called when the script is loaded or a value is changed in the Inspector (Called in the editor only).

        ////https://forum.unity.com/threads/onvalidate-gets-called-at-startup-before-properties-in-other-components-have-deserialized.452658/

        ////OnValidate is, I think, not intended to access data in other components, 
        //// and as such its execution order should not be relied on.

        ////You may be able to work around this by validating on both sides, e.g.:
